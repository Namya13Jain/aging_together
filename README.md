# Problem Statement
In India, the share of elderly people is more than 10% of the population, and among them also one out of every four elder person is lonely. This is due to the erosion of our traditional values to stay with our old parents. Their children leave them to succeed in their lives, forgetting that their parents need their love, care and support. Due to these reasons, a lot of them suffer from depression and related disorders. Here are some news reports as well:

# Future Scope
1. Personalized matching through AI
The future scope for Aging Together is vast, with the potential to further enhance the app's features and capabilities to better serve seniors. One exciting area of potential development is the integration of AI technologies to provide even more personalized and adaptive services to users.
For example, in the future, the app could use facial recognition technology to detect the mood of the elderly person and suggest companions or activities accordingly. This would enable the app to provide a more tailored and responsive experience, ensuring that seniors always have the support and companionship they need, even if they are unable to express their emotions directly.

2. Mentorship from various professionals
In addition to AI, the app could also expand its mentorship program to include professionals from various fields. This would provide seniors with a broader range of expertise and opportunities for learning, enabling them to stay engaged and up-to-date on the latest trends and developments in their areas of interest. Even group sessions in offline mode would be incorporated to help help the seniors learn with their friends.

3. Multi-language support
Old buddies may not be as comfortable in English language. So to ease out the navigation through our app, we have thought of providing multi-language support like in Hindi.

Overall, the future scope for Aging Together is exciting, with the potential to further revolutionize the way we think about senior care and support. As technology continues to evolve, the app will undoubtedly continue to innovate and adapt, providing seniors with even more personalized and responsive services.
